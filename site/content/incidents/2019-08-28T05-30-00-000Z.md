The in app purchase to upgrade to Bowlr Pro is not working on iOS. A fix has been submitted to the Apple App Store that will resolve this.

**Update 1**: The Apple App Store reviewers are not allowing the fixed version to be published. We are working with them to get this published ASAP. {{< track "2019-08-31T11:00:00.000Z" >}}
